# MiVet
MiVet is a mobile and web app that streamlines equine veterinary care. Its main features are two-way messaging/video calls, a shared platform for document storage, appointment/scheduling, and simplified billing.
It is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code for the Practices and Vet Dashboard page.
